# TypeScript with React AddOn
This lab is about creating a basic React application for random users, using the `https://randomuser.me/api/` API to return a random user.

## Task
The task is to:

- Display at least the users `address`, `age` and `name` in the UI.
- Make it possible to change the name through a form input (without sending a POST request, just update the name in the UI).
- For each new load of the application, a new user should appear.

## Goal
The goal is to get familiar with TypeScript in React. Read the documentation to get to know the existing types supplied by React, and practice applying TypeScript as much as possible:
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `props`
